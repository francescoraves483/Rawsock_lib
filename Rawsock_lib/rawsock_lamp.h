/** \file 
	Extra <b>La</b>tency <b>M</b>easurement <b>P</b>rotocol (custom protocol) support, developed in Politecnico di Torino.

	This file represents an additional module of the Rawsock library, adding support for a custom L7 protocol, which
	can be encapsulated inside any packet and transported using any protocol, providing a tool to measure latency
	between wireless (and wired) devices. We decided to call it <i>LaMP</i> (Latency Measurement Protocol).

	This file uses rawsock.h, but it is not included within the main module, allowing the user to include the Rawsock library
	without forcing him/her to include also the LaMP module, if he/she does not need it.

	The version number of this module is set to be the same as the main Rawsock library version number.

	or "ping-like (bidirectional) end request - timestampless" or "unidirectional stop" (depending on the current session type).

	If it is **FLG_CONTINUE** the current packet will not be threated as the last one, and its type won't be changed (it remains as specified before,
	for example by means of lampHeadPopulate().

	<b>FLG_NONE</b> can be used in all the cases in which the user does not need to specify if the current packet is the last one or not (e.g. ACK and INIT packets).

	Please see rawLampSend(), as the existence of this enumerator is directly linked to this function.
