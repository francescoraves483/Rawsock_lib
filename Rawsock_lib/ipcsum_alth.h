	IP checksum calculation alternative header - from Linux kernel 4.19.1 (not an original work)

	This header file gives access to a function (ip_fast_csum()) that can be used to
	compute, in an efficient and reliable way, the IPv4 checksum to be put inside the corresponding field of the IPv4 header.

	It represents an alternative user-space header to access the Linux kernel ip_fast_csum() function.

	This is not an original work: this function comes from the [Linux kernel 4.19.1](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.19.1/source/lib/checksum.c#L110), 
	released under GNU GPL version 2. There is no modification to its code.

	The function, even though it is used internally in the main Rawsock module, is available through a separate
	header in order to enable any application to use it separately in user space, when needed.

	\version Rawsock library verion: 0.3.0; Linux kernel version: 4.19.1
